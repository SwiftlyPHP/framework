# Style Guide
## About

Swiftly and all it's component libraries use a style based losely on the popular
PSR-2 and PSR-12 standards. While our code makes generous use of most of the
patterns established in those specifications, we've also taken the liberty to
extend and amend them in places where it makes sense to do so to better suit our
own preferences and the needs of the framework.

The goals of our style guide are simple:

* Increase readability
* Allow code to be self documenting
* Reduce cognitive overhead required to understand code
* Easier onboarding for new contributors
* Make future maintenance easier

By applying these styles uniformly to all parts of the Swiftly codebase, we hope
to make working on the project that much nicer and shorten the time required to
get up to speed with the project.
